# About

Some thoughts to help provide context around some of these graphs. 
## 2024 W14: Du Bois Challenge 

At first I made a tree chart and then realized that I wanted to actually visualize all 330 graduates as a way to honor them. I made the first waffle chart entirely in R, but after a few days realized that I wanted to make a faceted waffle chart. I was able to brute force the package into making facets, but the text didn't cooperate at that point. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the finished product. 

## 2018 W1: US Tuition 

I went all the way back to the beginning and my first visualizatio was the ridge plot. I then saw a table with sparklines somewhere online and decided to use the same data to learn how to make a table with sparklines. Visualizing all 50 states made for a really long table, so I created three versions: a short table with the ten states that saw the greatest increase in tuition, a super long table with all 50 states listed vertically (seen [here](https://github.com/zanewolf/tidytuesday/blob/main/2018_W1_%20Tuition/Table.png), and a final version where I outputted three smaller tables and compiled them together in AI.
